# GRC Mapping (NIST CSF)

This document connects each stage of the honeypot â†’ SIEM â†’ incident response workflow to relevant NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) functions, categories, and subcategories. The goal is to demonstrate how hands-on detection and response align with compliance and governance.

---

## Step 1: Deploy Honeypot (Detection)
- **Lab Action:** Installed and configured Cowrie SSH honeypot to capture malicious login attempts.  
- **NIST CSF Mapping:**  
  - **DE.CM-7 (Security Continuous Monitoring):** The network is monitored to detect potential cybersecurity events.  
- **Why It Fits:** Honeypot provides continuous visibility into unauthorized access attempts.

## Step 2: SIEM Alert Triggered (Identification)
- **Lab Action:** Forwarded Cowrie logs into Wazuh/Splunk; created alert rule for brute-force activity.  
- **NIST CSF Mapping:**  
  - **DE.DP-4 (Detection Processes):** Event detection information is communicated to appropriate parties.  
- **Why It Fits:** SIEM alerts transform raw log data into actionable security events.

## Step 3: Containment & Isolation (Response)
- **Lab Action:** Simulated isolating the honeypot VM / blocking malicious IP.  
- **NIST CSF Mapping:**  
  - **RS.MI-1 (Mitigation):** Activities are performed to prevent expansion of an event and to resolve the incident.  
  - **RS.CO-2 (Response Communication):** Incidents are reported consistent with established response processes.  
- **Why It Fits:** Containment actions reduce impact while following defined response steps.

## Step 4: Attack Analysis (Response)
- **Lab Action:** Analyzed honeypot logs to confirm repeated brute-force attempts and attacker IP.  
- **NIST CSF Mapping:**  
  - **RS.AN-1 (Analysis):** Notifications from detection systems are investigated.  
- **Why It Fits:** Reviewing logs and alert data aligns with incident analysis requirements.

## Step 5: Mitigation & Recovery
- **Lab Action:** Applied simulated hardening steps (disable root login, enforce key-based auth, firewall rules).  
- **NIST CSF Mapping:**  
  - **RC.IM-1 (Improvements):** Recovery planning and processes are improved by incorporating lessons learned.  
- **Why It Fits:** Documenting improvements ensures the organization adapts and strengthens resilience after incidents.

## Summary
- **Detect:** Honeypot provided visibility into unauthorized SSH access attempts.  
- **Respond:** SIEM alerts, containment, and analysis simulated incident response.  
- **Recover:** Mitigation steps and lessons learned showed organizational resilience.  

This lab demonstrates how **technical Blue Team activities** (honeypot + SIEM + incident handling) can be mapped to **governance frameworks** (NIST CSF), providing both security value and compliance alignment.
