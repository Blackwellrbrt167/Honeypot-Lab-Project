# Docker Installation (Lab Documentation)

This document provides a **complete walkthrough** of installing **Docker Engine** on **Ubuntu 24.04 (Honeypot-VM)**.  
It includes the **exact commands used** during installation and the **screenshots** that visually demonstrate each step.  
This setup forms the foundation for deploying the **Shuffle SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)** platform in a controlled lab environment.

## What is Docker?

According to [Docker.com](https://www.docker.com/), **Docker** is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.  
Docker uses **containerization technology** to separate applications from the underlying system, ensuring that they run consistently across different environments.

In simple terms, a **container** is an isolated environment that includes everything needed to run an applicationâ€”code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.  
This isolation ensures that the host systemâ€™s resources are not directly impacted and that each application runs independently of others.

For the purposes of this project, Docker is being used to deploy **Shuffle SOAR**. Containers serve two primary roles in this security automation context:

1. **Data Structures for Security Events** â€“ Containers help structure and process incident data in isolated environments.
2. **Self-Contained Deployment Environments** â€“ Each component of the SOAR platform (e.g., APIs, dashboards, integrations) runs in its own containerized environment.

In short, Docker enables scalable, reliable, and secure deployment of cybersecurity automation tools like Shuffle.
