## 2025-09-09 | Day 1 – Honeypot Project Kickoff

### Raw Notes
Today was invigorating in that I was excited to get started with the honeypot project. When an idea enters my head I begin to constantly think about it — where it could go, what I’m going to learn, and just the overall anticipatory excitement of learning something new.  

In this case, it was the thought of creating a honeypot, gathering data, studying a SIEM, and then doing a GRC mapping of the material. With me not having experience from a professional standpoint of such a task, I felt it important to gain hands-on skills.  

After watching a YouTube video (which was more about incident response — the GRC part was my addition since that’s my ultimate goal), the spark hit. I knew I needed to break down this monumental, ongoing task into a minimum of 1 hr/day to complete and wanted to journal my experiences accordingly.  

Today represented the first day in which I read documentation on the three most widely used honeypots: Cowrie, Dionaea, and T-Pot. Given that I’m somewhat intermediate with Linux, I narrowed it down to Cowrie and Dionaea after reading their installation documentation. Both were detailed as to what the commands were doing and what they meant — so no harm, no foul.  

In the end, I chose Cowrie because it was the fastest to get up and running. While speed isn’t my ultimate goal (life-long mastery is), I wanted to take massive action today — in the name of Tony Robbins.  

So to summarize: today was spent building out my GitHub page to hold the information as I build the VM for the project and work with the respective SIEMs, honeypots, and documentation. This is where AI was huge: I used it to build a template. But even with AI, it took time because the formatting was tricky.  

In this instance, I am using AI as a **companion** — less to carry me, more to guide me in the right direction. The research, reading of docs, reflections, and learning were all me. Frustrating at times, yes, but also exhilarating. I’m learning so much and immediately able to put concepts into practice that I’m also covering in school.
