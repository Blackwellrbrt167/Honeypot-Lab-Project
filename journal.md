## 2025-09-09 – Honeypot Project Kickoff

### Raw Notes
With the raw notes in place and with the understanding of what I did today, you now know what was accomplished on Day One. I even took the time to research just what a honeypot is. See below:

- The purpose of a honeypot is to be used as a mechanism as an attack target to lure attackers away from their intended target.  

- Once the attacker is inside the honeypot will gather intelligence about the identity methods, and motivations of adversaries.  

- A honeypot can be modeled after any digital asset, this can include software applications, servers, or it can mimic the network itself. In laymen's terms the honeypot acts as a decoy.  

- A network of honeypots is defined as a honeynet. The design of a honeypot should mimic the network target an organization is trying to defend. Keep in mind that cybercriminals can also use honeypots as well.  

- The most common type of honeypot is the production honeypot.  

- Research honeypots are designed to collect information about the specific methods and techniques used by adversaries and what possible vulnerabilities exist.  

- Honeypots can be broken down into the type of activity I seek to detect.

Just based upon my research and the relative simplicity, I will begin with Cowrie. The truth is that Dionaea was not that bad and I could understand what it was asking of me — that’s just because of education.  

As far as T-Pot was concerned, it was hard to understand anything. For them it was difficult to find the steps to set up the honeypot. Although I understood some of the material, I had to go through everything to attempt to locate where any documentation discussing the setup was found. The page was just so unorganized.
